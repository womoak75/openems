/**
 * BridgeHttpCycle to handle request to a endpoint based on the cycle.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If a request is scheduled every cycle and the request does take longer than
 * one cycle it is not executed multiple times instead it waits until the last
 * request is finished and will be executed with the next cycle.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A simple example to subscribe to an endpoint every cycle would be:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * this.httpBridge.subscribeEveryCycle("http://127.0.0.1/status", t -> {
 * 	// process data
 * }, t -> {
 * 	// handle error
 * });
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If an endpoint does not require to be called every cycle it can also be
 * configured with e. g.
 * {@link BridgeHttpCycle#subscribeCycle(int, String, Consumer)} where the first
 * value could be 5 then the request gets triggered every 5th cycle.
